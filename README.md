# Data Analysis Project using Python and My Sql

This is a repository of teaching materials, code, and data for my data analysis learning projects.

Be sure to check the documentation (usually in IPython Notebook format) in the directory you're interested in for the notes on the analysis, data usage terms, etc.

If you don't have the necessary software installed to run IPython Notebook, don't fret. You can use [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/) to view a notebook on the web.

For example, if you want to view the notebook in the `Data_Analysis` directory, copy the [full link](https://github.com/Farhinsyd/Data_Analysis/blob/main/VideoGameSales2016.ipynb) to the notebook then paste it into [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/Farhinsyd/Data_Analysis/blob/main/VideoGameSales2016.ipynb).


You are free to:
* **Share**—copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format

* **Adapt**—remix, transform, and build upon the material
for any purpose, even commercially.
